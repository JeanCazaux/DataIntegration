### Overview
tTimeGenerator is a component that can generate simple time dimension tables for YEAR, QUARTER and MONTH levels.

A sample job demonstrates how to create 3 separate tables or to combine them into a single time dimension table.

Often in BI projects it is more handy to have separate levels in order to perform relative time calculations or feed picklists for user prompts.

## <img src='./logo.jpg' width='40' height='40'>Facebook Application Insights Component

### Overview
A component that connects to Facebook to retrieve application information (the kind of information that Facebook calls "Insights").

The component uses the application id and secret code (they are available to app admins) to obtain an access token, then it uses the access token to retrieve the information.

The process will be properly documented soon, with some examples.
Check the associated links for more details

Note : This does NOT retrieve personal feeds, wall feeds etc as this kind of activity requires a different OAuth token that cannot be retrieved without human intervention (at least based on my knowledge)

### Overview
Java routine for dealing with dynamic schemas.  As an example, say you have a defined Excel spreadsheet that contains a given number of columns.  The number of these columns is static and there is a predefined schema into which it must fit.  The caveat is according to the business rules, the columns for the schema may be in a different order than they actually appear in the excel spreadsheet.  This is a dynamic schema, meaning the order of the columns can change but they still must meet a defined schema.

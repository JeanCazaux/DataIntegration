 :warning: Compatibility not known

Contains all of the items and a sample job for using the dynamic schema routine that I uploaded yesterday.  There's a spreadsheet in the documentation section of the repository that contains two worksheets.  One of them has the columns in the correct order, the other does not.  The zip also contains the routine, metadata for the file, and context items.

 :warning: Compatibility not known

Java routine for dealing with dynamic schemas.  As an example, say you have a defined Excel spreadsheet that contains a given number of columns.  The number of these columns is static and there is a predefined schema into which it must fit.  The caveat is according to the business rules, the columns for the schema may be in a different order than they actually appear in the excel spreadsheet.  This is a dynamic schema, meaning the order of the columns can change but they still must meet a defined schema.

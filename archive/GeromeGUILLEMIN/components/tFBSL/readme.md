### Overview
tFBSL routine for Talend 

Welcome to the the tFBSL routine code for Talend 3.x series ! 
This will explain to you how to install and use the tFBSL routine for Talend software. 

BTW, what does FBSL for Talend? 
Talend is a great ELT software,that runs under Java platform, but unfortunately we can not make 
graphical plugins easily, nor windows, nor dialogs on the fly with it! 
People that are familiar with Windows environment are always using their mouse and click onto graphical 
widgets to interact with this operating system, that seems quite natural. 
But if you are familiar with Windows and fond of Talend, you've probably been noticed that no widget 
tool is actually provided for developing nice and sweet graphical interfaces! 
So, my programming language project called FBSL (development started in 2001) has evolved since 
years and is capable of interpreting and creating powerful and complex graphical user interfaces with 
ease by the way of one of its two engine, and FBSL.DLL is the one that we'll use via Talend / Java class! 

Are you ready?
Ok let's go!

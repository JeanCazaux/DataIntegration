### Overview
This component is derivated from tFileInputProperties.

The input properties or ini file is read from Java resources instead of a physical file. This resource file must be in the classpath (in a directory or a jar file included in the classpath).

I use this component to load a job context without specifying the input file location. When I launch the job, I just add the file location in the classpath.

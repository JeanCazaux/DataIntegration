### Overview
Evolution of Talend's original tFileList component :
- optimization of generated java code
- exclude file mask is now a table where several filemasks can be excluded at the same time
- even if a file matches more than one filemask, it is sent only once in the "iterate" link to be processed
- file and folder advanced sort options
     - folders before or after files in the iterate link
     - file sort by name, size, or modification date, ascending or descending order in the iterate link

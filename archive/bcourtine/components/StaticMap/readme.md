### Overview
This component provides tools to store values in a Map.

Unlike the job "globalMap", this Map is static, and can be accessed outside of the job. This Map can be used :
- as an alternative to context variables for job params (if the job is launched by another Java program)
- to keep job infos after execution (if the job is launched by another Java program)
- to share infos between a parent and a child job (in both directions "parent > child" and "child > parent")

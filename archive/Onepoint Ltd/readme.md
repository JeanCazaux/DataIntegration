 :warning: Compatibility not known

**Google Cloud Pub/Sub** brings the scalability, flexibility, and reliability of enterprise message-oriented middleware to the cloud. It is a fully-managed real-time messaging service that allows you to send and receive messages asynchronously between applications, thereby decoupling senders and receivers. It is designed to provide “at least once” delivery at low latency with on-demand scalability to 1 million messages per second (and beyond).

The Onepoint **tGooglePubsubInput** and **tGooglePubsubOutput** components allow Talend developers/integrators to leverage Google's cloud based enterprise message-oriented middleware by enabling data integration jobs to consume and write standard JSON messages from and to this messaging middleware.

The component assumes a correctly configured Google Pub/Sub infrastructure. Please visit: [Google Pub/Sub documentation](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/overview) for additional information om Google Pub/Sub, its architecture and setup guides.

Note
------

Please note that unlike most DI components the **tGooglePubsubInput** will listen to the incoming messages of a topic and therefore the job will only finish when the user terminates the job.

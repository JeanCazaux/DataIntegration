### Overview
**Apache Kudu** is a revolutionary new columnar store for Hadoop that enables the powerful combination of fast analytics on fast data. Kudu complements the existing Hadoop storage options, **HDFS** and **Apache HBase**. Additional information on **Apache Kudu**, its architecture and use cases can be found at (http://getkudu.io/).

Onepoint provides two components that enable reading data from and writing data to Kudu which is the first native Hadoop storage engine that supports both low-latency random access and high-throughput analytics. This enables seamless integration between your organization's multiple, heterogeneous data source and Kudu.

### Details

### Overview
Onepoint support a set of generic Google components which support existing Onepoint components. Components like e.g. the **tGoogleAPIConnection** component are not to be used as standalone components, but together with other Onepoint components, like e.g. **tGooglePubSubInput** or **tGooglePubSubOutput**.
### Details
**tGoogleAPIConnection** is similar to many Talend connection components allowing to share a common resource - in this case the OAUTH2 credentials - with multiple job components. This component will in general terms improve the performance of your jobs.

### Overview
A component that works with tScriptRules to provide a rule list.  In tScriptRules, a list of rules written in Javascript can be maintained in a table accessible through the Component View.  tScriptRulesLoad enables the rules to be loaded from another source such as a flat file, tFixedFlowInput, database, or even a web service.  This is accomplished using the normal Talend mechanisms (tFileInputDelimted -> tScriptRulesLoad).
